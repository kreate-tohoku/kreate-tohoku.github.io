abstract: "Earth's subduction zone processes and surface environments are intricately governed by mass transfer phenomena at plate convergent boundaries. The determination of their rates and timings from high-pressure metamorphic rocks (e.g., eclogite), or remnants of ancient convergent boundaries, remains an ongoing challenge. Here, we proposed the potential and versatility of ordering transformation kinetics of omphacite, an essential mineral found in eclogite, as a dynamic recorder of the metamorphic history. Through macroscopic phase-field simulation, we explored the growth of antiphase domains (APDs) in metastable disordered omphacite, discussing the feasibility of constraining metamorphic reaction kinetics based on the size and morphology of omphacite APDs in eclogitized oceanic crust. Our simulation corroborated that omphacite nucleating later during the prograde metamorphism can exhibit an incompletely ordered state with sparsely distributed ordered domains, which suggests their usefulness in estimating the recrystallization timing of the omphacite. Additionally, we confirmed that the APD formation dynamics are significantly influenced by the initial cation configuration of the disordered matrix. This implies the APD morphology in natural omphacite under slab-surface conditions may reflect their precipitation kinetics. These findings provide valuable insights into the microtextural evolution of omphacite due to its ordering transformation, thereby enhancing our ability to interpret morphological features."
